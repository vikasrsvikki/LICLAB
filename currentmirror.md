CURRENT MIRRORING EXPERIMENT

Introduction 

A current mirror is a circut designed to duplicate a current from one branch of a circut to another. it is often usde in analog design to provide a stable reference current that can be replicate through various part of the circut , typically in differential amplifier or other type of active circut current mirror are widly used due to their high output resistence , improved accuracy , and ability to maintain constant independent of voltage variation . the experiment involve simulating different currnt mirror circut ,such as basic current mirrors , ans cascade current mirrors to analyse their performence , current transfer accuracy , the voltage dependencies , by understanding their circuits , enginnners can design efficient current source and biasing networks for various analog and mixed-signal application

Purpose of current mirroring circuits:
